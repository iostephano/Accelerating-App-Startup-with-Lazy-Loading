# Accelerating-App-Startup-with-Lazy-Loading
# Description
This mini-project demonstrates how to optimize iOS app launch performance by deferring heavy work until it’s actually needed. At launch, only essential UI elements are initialized. Preview images, detailed views, and expensive decoding tasks are loaded on demand, resulting in a snappier, more responsive startup experience.

## Project Structure
AcceleratingAppStartup/
* AppDelegate.swift
* SceneDelegate.swift
* CardModel.swift
* CardCollectionViewCell.swift
* CardsStackViewController.swift
* ProjectDetailViewController.swift
* Assets.xcassets/preview1.png, preview2.png, preview3.png

## How It Works
1. **App Launch**  
   - `SceneDelegate` (or `AppDelegate`) sets up a `UINavigationController` whose root is `CardsStackViewController`.
   - Only the main title label and a blurred stack of project cards are rendered immediately.

2. **Card Display**  
   - Each `CardCollectionViewCell` uses a `UIVisualEffectView` to show a premium blur effect.
   - A placeholder image view is reserved but not populated until needed.

3. **On-Demand Loading**  
   - Tapping a card pushes `ProjectDetailViewController` onto the navigation stack.
   - A `UIActivityIndicatorView` spinner simulates a 2-second loading period.
   - After the delay, the preview image and project description fade in.

4. **Navigation**  
   - Users can tap Back to return to the card stack, with the navigation bar restored.

## Ideas for Extension
- **Real Data Source**  
  Fetch project metadata and images from a remote API instead of bundling assets locally.
- **Pagination & Caching**  
  Load cards in pages and cache preview thumbnails for offline performance.
- **Dynamic Themes**  
  Support light & dark modes with custom blur/material styles.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**  
  Allow users to refresh the project list and see updated cards on demand.
- **Prefetching Strategy**  
  Use `UICollectionViewDataSourcePrefetching` to begin loading previews just before a card scrolls into view.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**
- **UIKit**  
  - `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`  
  - `UIVisualEffectView` (Blur)  
  - `UIActivityIndicatorView` (Spinner)  
  - Programmatic Auto Layout
- **Model–View–Controller** Architecture
